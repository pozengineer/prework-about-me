      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>A highly motivated and hardworking individual, undertaking a programming course who is seeking a
        learning- based role in an IT Company. My education, self-taught knowledge and experience combined
        with my interest and passion in Cloud Computing and Virtualisation, Servers, and Coding will allow
        me to learn, contribute and excel in the Information & Technology Industry. Building computers and
        providing general IT support and troubleshooting has given me a technicalunderstanding of computer
        components, hardware, software, and network configuration.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Australia</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Some of my hobbies include swimming, surfing, and watching anime</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Software Engineer</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Sydney, New South Wales</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have a Bachelors Degree in Mechanical Engineering but unfortunatly have been unable to obtain
          full-time employment with the skills that I have acquired during my university studies. I have
          decided to undertake a career change in coding and hopefully develop skills that will enable me
          to secure employment that will allow me to provide for my family. I hope to develop a strong
          foundation in coding with this course.</p>
